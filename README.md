EDDI 

This code provide a tested method to calculate Evaporative Demand Drought Index (EDDI) based on Log-logistic distibution. We include two functions: calculate_eddi() to compute EDDI for a point or pixel of interest, and calculate_eddi_netcdf() to transform an ETo NetCDFf into an EDDI NetCDF. In this case, we calculate EDDI at 1-month time scale and weekly frequency.
